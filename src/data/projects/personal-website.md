## Evolution

I've rebuilt this website several times with different technologies and frameworks depending on what I want to learn. Previous versions were built with React, then Next.js, and now with Astro for simplicity.

If you want to check the previous (worse) versions:

- React: [Frontend](https://github.com/jaycem-dev/portfolio-frontend), [Backend](https://github.com/jaycem-dev/portfolio-backend-django), [Live version](https://portfolio-frontend-jaycedams-projects.vercel.app/) (react, django, postgresql)
- Next.js: [Frontend](https://github.com/jaycem-dev/portfolio-next), [Live version](https://portfolio-next-jaycedams-projects.vercel.app) (nextjs, tailwindcss, prisma, mysql)

## MD Content

Using Astro's Content Collections I can have a content directory with typesafe frontmatter for my local MD/MDX files using TypeScript.
I chose Astro for its Island architecture, which allows a mostly static site with dynamic content where needed.

## View Transitions

With View Transitions I can create an MPA with the feeling of an SPA by having elements persist through route changes.
