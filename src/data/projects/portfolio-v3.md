## MDX Content

Using Astro's Content Collections I can have a content folder with typesafe frontmatter for my local MDX files using Typescript. The DX is better since Astro handles the MDX compilation with built-in features such as code syntax highlighting and slugs.

Since my portfolio website is mostly based on content, the Island architecture is better for a site like this, where I can scale interactivity on specific modules.

## View Transitions

This allows me to create an MPA with the feeling of a SPA by having elements persist through route changes. Currently only supported on Chromium browsers but the rest of the browsers already confirmed support for this feature.

## It's just faster

Since I only ship the necessary JS, the whole site is much faster than previous versions.
